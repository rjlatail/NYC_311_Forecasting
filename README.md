# Forecasting Usage of NYC's 311 Service

Since 2003, New York City has maintained the 311 service, a hub that connects residents to city agencies and provide them with quick and easy access to local government.  It has become the first stop for residents for a whole host of concerns:

- To secure official documents, such as business, pet or marriage licenses
- To get a business, pet or marriage license
- To stay up-to-date on public school calendars, including snow days
- To be informed about city-wide parking rules
- To inform city agencies about quality of life concerns such as noise or litter
- To request maintenance for city-owned apartments and buildings
- To make payments towards property taxes, parking tickets, or other city assessments

While the cost to the city is not large ($68 million out of a $107 annual billion budget, or less than 0.1%) the value it provides to residents and government officials is considerably more.
